GNOME Shell Weather Extension
=============================

The GNOME Shell Weather Extension is a simple extension for displaying weather
notifications in GNOME Shell.

Currently, the weather report including forecast for today and tomorrow is
fetched from Yahoo! Weather.

[This particular version](https://github.com/kthu/gnome-shell-extension-weather)
has been extended to include information from Ricco Førgaards digital lithium
[Hvor meget er dagen tiltaget?](http://sidensolhverv.dk). An extra line of text
telling you how much longer or shorter the day has become since the last
solstice and since yesterday will display if "Show sunrise/sunset times" is
enabled.

Installation
------------

To install the extension for every user in the computer, run the
following commands as a regular user:

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr && make

and then as root (or using sudo):

    make install

Make sure you have the libglib2.0-dev package (or equivalent for
your distribution) installed.

If you want to install the extension only for your user, you can do
the following:

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/.local --with-local-install=yes
    make
    make install

After installing the extension restart GNOME Shell by doing "Alt-F2
r ENTER", and then enable it with the gnome-tweak-tool.

To uninstall the extension just do:

    make uninstall

or (if you installed it locally) just delete its directory:

    rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/weather@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org

Remember to first disable it with the gnome-tweak-tool.

Versions
--------

Due to incompatible changes between the different versions of GNOME
Shell, we are currently only supporting GNOME Shell 3.6. However, we
have branches for older versions.

Configuration
-------------

You can use the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool to configure the
extension. To launch the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool you can
either do Alt+F2 gnome-shell-extension-prefs ENTER, or you can go to
the Shell Extension section of the Tweak Tool. Next to the check
button for the Weather Extension should be a button that launches
the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool.

All the configuration changes are reflected in the extension
immediately, there is no need to disable and enable again the
extension.

You can see more screenshots of the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool
in action in the Screenshots page.

There is an additional option available for the extension, not
visible from the preferences dialog. It allows the user to override
the weather details URL, which defaults to the one provided by
Yahoo! You can override the URL via gsettings if the extension is
installed globally for all users:

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather details-url \
   "http://www.weather.com/weather/right-now/MXDF0132"

or with dconf if the extension is installed for only one user in
$HOME/.local/share:

dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/weather/details-url \
   "'http://www.weather.com/weather/right-now/MXDF0132'"

Note the single quotes inside the double quotes; they are necessary
since dconf needs its values in GVariant format.

Location
--------

The GNOME Shell Weather Extension uses Yahoo!'s Location IDs to know
what weather data should be requested. The preferences for the
extension includes a Location ID searcher: you only need to click in
the "Search for Location ID" button, enter the name of your town or
city, and press ENTER or click in the "Search" button. A list of
locations that matches your search will fill the combo box so you
can select the correct one.
